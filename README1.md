## üîç Insights Deep Dive

### 1. Sales Performance Analysis

#### Revenue Trajectory: France Accelerating, Benelux Plateauing

![Revenue Trend](visuals/01_revenue_trend.png)

**Key Observations:**

- **France Growth Momentum**: First 6 months averaged ‚Ç¨436K/month, last 6 months ‚Ç¨497K/month (+14% growth)
- **Benelux Plateau**: First 6 months ‚Ç¨108K/month, last 6 months ‚Ç¨116K/month (+7.2% growth)
- **Gap Widening**: France's acceleration (14%) is 2x faster than Benelux (7%), indicating diverging trajectories
- **Consistency**: France maintains higher average with lower volatility (CoV: 9% vs Benelux 12%)

**Implication**: France's momentum is building while Benelux stagnates. Without intervention, the performance gap will widen exponentially in 2026.

---

### 2. Tier Performance: The Smoking Gun

#### Revenue per Clinic by Tier

![Tier Performance](visuals/02_tier_performance.png)

**Key Observations:**

- **10x Gap at Top Tier**: France Top-tier clinics generate ‚Ç¨291K vs Benelux ‚Ç¨30K
- **3.3x Gap at Medium Tier**: France ‚Ç¨80K vs Benelux ‚Ç¨24K
- **1.7x Gap at Low Tier**: France ‚Ç¨22K vs Benelux ‚Ç¨12K
- **Critical Finding**: Benelux "Top-tier" clinics perform worse than France Medium-tier clinics

**Tier Distribution Analysis:**

| Market | Tier | Clinics | Revenue % | Rev/Clinic |
|--------|------|---------|-----------|------------|
| France | Top | 4 (1%) | 7% | ‚Ç¨291K |
| France | Medium | 123 (31%) | 58% | ‚Ç¨80K |
| France | Low | 273 (68%) | 35% | ‚Ç¨22K |
| **Benelux** | **Top** | **3 (1%)** | **2%** | **‚Ç¨30K** ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| Benelux | Medium | 70 (29%) | 44% | ‚Ç¨24K |
| Benelux | Low | 167 (70%) | 54% | ‚Ç¨12K |

**Root Cause**: Benelux clinic tiering system appears fundamentally miscalibrated. "Potential scores" assigned to clinics don't correlate with actual revenue performance.

**Implication**: ‚Ç¨800K+ annual opportunity exists by re-tiering Benelux clinics based on actual revenue data and reallocating rep time accordingly.

---

### 3. Coverage vs Conversion Quality

#### The Coverage Paradox

![Coverage vs Conversion](visuals/03_coverage_conversion.png)

**Key Observations:**

- **Similar Coverage Rates**: France 65% (260/400 clinics), Benelux 67% (160/240 clinics)
- **Vastly Different Outcomes**: 
  - France: Clinics with visits generate 45% more revenue than those without
  - Benelux: Clinics with visits generate only 15% more revenue
- **3x Conversion Gap**: France rep visits are 3x more effective at driving incremental revenue

**Root Cause Analysis:**

1. **Targeting Quality**: Benelux reps are visiting lower-potential clinics
2. **Visit Frequency**: May be too low to build momentum (correlation 0.13 vs France 0.37)
3. **Relationship Depth**: French rep-physician relationships appear stronger

**Implication**: Benelux's challenge isn't coverage‚Äîit's covering the right clinics with sufficient intensity. This is a targeting and execution problem, not a resource problem.

---

### 4. Rep Productivity Diagnostic

#### Revenue per Visit Performance

![Rep Productivity](visuals/04_rep_productivity.png)

**Key Observations:**

- **2.4x Productivity Gap**: France reps average ‚Ç¨1,172 per visit vs Benelux ‚Ç¨484
- **Top Performers**: All top 10 reps by revenue/visit are French or serve French territories
- **Consistency**: France reps show tighter distribution (lower variance), indicating standardized best practices
- **Correlation Strength**: 
  - France: 0.37 correlation between visits and future revenue (1-month lag)
  - Benelux: 0.13 correlation (weak predictive power)

**Productivity Breakdown:**

| Metric | France | Benelux | Gap |
|--------|--------|---------|-----|
| **Avg Visits per Rep** | 477 | 418 | +14% |
| **Avg Revenue per Rep** | ‚Ç¨563K | ‚Ç¨196K | +187% |
| **Revenue per Visit** | ‚Ç¨1,172 | ‚Ç¨484 | +142% |

**Implications:**

1. **Efficiency**: France reps generate 2.4x more value per visit despite only 14% more total visits
2. **Quality over Quantity**: The gap isn't effort‚Äîit's effectiveness
3. **Transferable Practices**: France clearly has replicable best practices that Benelux lacks

**Estimated Impact**: Closing 50% of the productivity gap would add ‚Ç¨360K annual revenue to Benelux operations.

---

### 5. Product Portfolio Analysis

#### Product Mix Composition

![Product Mix](visuals/05_product_mix.png)

**Key Observations:**

- **Similar Portfolio Mix**: Both markets show ~50% Fillers, ~40% Neuromodulators, ~10% SkinCare
- **No Product Bias**: Revenue gap is NOT due to product portfolio differences
- **Universal Appeal**: All product families perform proportionally across markets

**Implication**: Product mix is NOT the explanation for performance gaps. The same portfolio succeeds in France and struggles in Benelux, reinforcing that execution (targeting, rep effectiveness) is the differentiator.

---

### 6. Competitive Position

#### Market Share Analysis

![Market Share](visuals/07_market_share.png)

**Key Observations:**

- **Paradox**: Benelux has higher market share (29.8%) than France (24.7%) despite lower absolute revenue
- **France**: ‚Ç¨16.9M us vs ‚Ç¨51.5M competitors = 24.7% share in large market
- **Benelux**: ‚Ç¨3.9M us vs ‚Ç¨9.2M competitors = 29.8% share in smaller market

**Strategic Implication**: Benelux represents a market leadership opportunity. We already have the highest share; fixing execution could cement dominance and expand the market through better provider engagement.

---

### 7. Quarterly Performance

![Quarterly Performance](visuals/06_quarterly_performance.png)

**Key Observations:**

- **Consistent 4:1 Ratio**: France maintains ~4x Benelux revenue across all quarters
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Both markets show Q2 peaks (May-June aesthetic season) and Q4 lows (holiday period)
- **No Catch-Up**: Despite similar seasonal patterns, Benelux shows no signs of closing the gap

---

## üí° Recommendations

![Recommendations Table](visuals/recommendations_table.png)

### For Sales Leadership

#### Priority 1: Emergency Territory Realignment (Benelux)

**Action**: Implement 10% clinic reallocation focused on Top 20% potential clinics

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **Week 1-2**: Re-tier all Benelux clinics using actual 12-month revenue + 6-month growth trend
2. **Week 3-4**: Pilot in Netherlands region (35 clinics, 4 reps)
3. **Month 2-3**: Reallocate 20 clinics from Low ‚Üí Top/Medium coverage
4. **Month 3-6**: Increase Top-tier visit frequency from 0.5 ‚Üí 1.5 visits/month

**Expected Impact:**
- **Year 1**: +‚Ç¨800K revenue (21% increase in Benelux)
- **Payback Period**: Immediate (no new hires required)
- **Risk**: Low (pilot approach allows course correction)

---

#### Priority 2: Rep Coaching Program (Benelux)

**Observation**: Visit correlation to revenue is 0.13 vs France's 0.37

**Action**: Deploy French best practices to Benelux teams through structured coaching program

**Program Components:**
1. **Quarterly Rep Shadows**: Each Benelux rep shadows a France top-performer for 2 days/quarter
2. **Standardized Call Planning**: Roll out France's call planning template to Benelux
3. **Conversion Tracking**: Implement prescription follow-through metrics
4. **Monthly Peer Learning**: Virtual sessions where top France reps share tactics

**Expected Impact:**
- **6 Months**: Increase visit‚Üírevenue conversion by 50%
- **12 Months**: Close 30% of productivity gap with France
- **Revenue**: +‚Ç¨360K annual incremental

---

### For Marketing

#### Priority 1: Promotional Calendar Optimization

**Current State**: Only 3 promotions in 36 months (avg 132% uplift when executed)

**Action**: Implement quarterly promotional calendar with strategic timing

**Proposed Calendar:**
- **Q1 (Jan-Feb)**: "New Year Confidence" campaign
- **Q2 (May-Jun)**: Peak season bundled offerings
- **Q3 (Sep-Oct)**: Back-to-work refresh campaign
- **Q4 (Nov-Dec)**: Holiday gift card program

**Expected Impact:**
- **Promotional Months**: 15-20% revenue uplift
- **Annual Impact**: +‚Ç¨2.1M (France), +‚Ç¨540K (Benelux)
- **ROI**: 7:1

---

### For Operations

#### Priority 1: Clinic Tiering Model Revision

**Issue**: Benelux potential scores don't predict actual revenue (correlation <0.2)

**Action**: Rebuild tiering methodology using data-driven approach

**New Tiering Formula:**
```
Clinic Score = (0.50 √ó 12mo Revenue) + (0.30 √ó 6mo Growth Trend) + (0.20 √ó Specialty Mix)

Tiers:
- Top: Score ‚â•80th percentile
- Medium: Score 50-80th percentile  
- Low: Score <50th percentile
```

**Expected Impact:**
- **Accuracy**: Revenue predictability improves from 0.2 ‚Üí 0.65 correlation
- **Resource Allocation**: Reps spend time on clinics with highest ROI
